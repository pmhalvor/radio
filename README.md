# radio 

A webapp displaying user's content from Spotify. 

<!-- TODO Add iamge  -->

## Getting started
**Files needed:**
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env` needs the following variables:
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` (from [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `.token` (generated by the app after first run)

Alternatively, export the needed variables from `.env` in your shell.

**First run:**
Run the app on your local machine first, in order to authenticate Spotify via web browser. 
That process should generate a `.token` file in the root directory.

```
make run
```

**Serve from Docker:**
Once `.token` is generated, you can run the app from Docker.
The token needs to be mounted as a volume, 
which may require extra configuration if using Docker Desktop (more info in error message). 

```
docker compose up --build
```
